# Slack Gif Creator

Toolkit for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack, with validators for size constraints and composable animation primitives. This skill applies when users request animated GIFs or emoji animations for Slack from descriptions like "make me a GIF for Slack of X doing Y".

## Overview

A toolkit for creating animated GIFs optimized for Slack. Provides validators for Slack's constraints, composable animation primitives, and optional helper utilities. **Apply these tools however needed to achieve the creative vision.**

## Setup

This skill is designed to work with Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the Claude API.

### Installation

**For Claude.ai:**
1. Click the skill icon (🧩) in your chat interface
2. Add this skill from the marketplace or upload the SKILL.md file

**For Claude Code:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
cp -r slack-gif-creator ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
```

**For Claude API:**
```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    skills=["slack-gif-creator"],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}]
)
```

## Usage

# Bounce motion
    t_bounce = i / (num_frames - 1)
    y = interpolate(start_y, ground_y, t_bounce, 'bounce_out')

    # Add shake on impact (when y reaches ground)
    if y >= ground_y - 5:
        shake_x = math.sin(i * 2) * 10
        x = center_x + shake_x
    else:
        x = center_x

    draw_emoji(frame, '⚽', (x, y), size=60)
    builder.add_frame(frame)
```
