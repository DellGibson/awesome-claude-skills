# Performance Profiler & Optimizer

Analyze code performance, identify bottlenecks, calculate algorithmic complexity (Big O), and get optimization suggestions with measurable improvements.

## Features

- **Bottleneck Detection**: Nested loops, inefficient searches
- **Complexity Analysis**: Big O time and space complexity
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Specific improvements
- **Before/After**: Shows optimized code
- **Performance Metrics**: Estimated speedup ratios

## Installation

Available in Claude.ai, Claude Code, and Claude API.

## Usage

Ask Claude:
> "Analyze this function for performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations: [paste code]"

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate data structures (Map, Set)
- Avoid nested loops when possible
- Cache expensive calculations
- Use algorithms with better complexity
- Profile real-world performance
